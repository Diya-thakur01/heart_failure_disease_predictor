Heart Failure Prediction using Flask
This project is a simple web application built with Flask that predicts whether a person is likely to suffer from heart failure based on medical parameters using a trained machine learning model.

 Features
Predicts heart failure based on user input

Flask-based web app with HTML & CSS frontend

Trained ML model (model.pkl)

Scaler for input normalization (scaler.pkl)

 Technologies Used
Python

Flask

HTML/CSS

Machine Learning (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)

Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
